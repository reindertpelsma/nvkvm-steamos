# second cpio archive to Alpine's stock `initramfs-virt` (the kernel unpacks

# loading uses), and selected with `rdinit=/nvkvm/guest-init.sh` on the kernel
# command line. Alpine's own /init is left untouched and never runs.

# Everything here is busybox + kmod. The heavy lifting is done by Valve's own
# tools, run inside a chroot on the SteamOS repair rootfs — so this script's
# only jobs are: mount the kernel filesystems, get the kernel modules that
# `initramfs-virt` does NOT ship (nvme, btrfs, ext4) out of `modloop-virt`,
# assemble the chroot, and run the requested stages.

#   nvkvm.shell_on_fail=1             drop to a shell if a stage fails

# its own populates neither /run/udev nor /dev/disk/*. Valve's tools assume a
# Deck, where udev is running, and they degrade in ways that are hard to read:
#
#   * MEASURED: `lsblk --pairs -o NAME,PKNAME,PARTTYPE,PARTUUID,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT`
#     returns EMPTY PARTTYPE/PARTUUID/FSTYPE without a udev database. steamcl-install's
#     find_esp() then falls through to its loose "just match /esp" branch, leaves
#     $esp_partuuid empty, and need_new_efi_boot_entry passes only two arguments to
#     check_boot_path — which is `set -eu`, so it dies with the maximally
#     unhelpful "steamcl-install: line 464: 3: unbound variable".
#   * /dev/disk/by-partsets/* never appears, which steamos-chroot uses whenever
#     it is called WITHOUT --disk.
#
# The fix is not to patch Valve's scripts but to give them the environment they
# expect: the repair image ships udevadm (systemd-udevd is a symlink to it), so
# run the real thing inside the chroot. It needs only /dev, /sys and /run, all

# repair_device.sh sizes both rootfs slots at 5120 MiB and dd's a 5 GiB image
# into each. Valve's own content is already 3.45 GiB of that, so a slot has
# ~870 MiB free on 20260707.10 and ~374 MiB on the ~300 MB fatter 20260716.1 --
# not enough for the NVIDIA userspace, which is why provisioning had to trim
# CUDA, delete Valve's firmware, and still failed a real OTA by 42 MB.
#
# Applied as a patch rather than a sed so that an upstream change to that block
# STOPS US rather than silently producing a differently-sized disk. Dry-run
# first; a failure here aborts the install with the reason on screen.
